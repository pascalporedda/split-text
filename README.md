#SplitText 

SplitText is a simple library that helps you animate your HTML elements in an 
easier way by splitting elements into several elements by preserving accessibility
for impaired users.

The original source is based off a jQuery Plugin called [Blast.JS for Velocity.JS](https://github.com/julianshapiro/blast).
I thought that it would be nice to have a version that is compatible without jQuery
and is strictly typed as there were some flaws in the original source. 

This library does not provide all options that Blast.JS provides, if you rely on
any option that SplitText does not provide feel free to submit an issue via GitHub.

# Installing SplitText

TBD.

### TODOs:
- Add test cases
- Simple CI / CD?
